Alaw

Performs Alaw nonlinear quantization

Calling Sequence

[Cx,Xmax] = Alaw(x,A)

Parameters

x: input vector
A: compression factor
Cx: A-law compressor output
Xmax: maximum of input vector

Description

Alaw -performs A-law nonlinear quantization

Examples

x = [0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1];//normalized input
A = 1;//A=2,A=100
[Cx,Xmax] = Alaw(x,A);
plot(x,Cx);
