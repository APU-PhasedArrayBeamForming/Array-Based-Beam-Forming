ampmod

Amplitude modulation -Double Sideband Full Carrier(DSBFC)

Calling Sequence

[x] = ampmod(Ec,Em,fm,fc,fs)

Parameters

x: AM modulated signal
fc:carrier frequency in Hz
Em:message signal amplitude in volts
Ec:carrier signal amplitude in volts
fs:sampling frequency in samples/sec
fm:modulating signal frequency in Hz

Description

ampmod -performs amplitude modulation -Double Sideband With carrier AM wave.

Examples

Em = 8; //8 volts
Ec = 10; //20 volts
fm = 2; //2 Hz
fc = 10; //10 Hz
fs = 100; samples/sec
x = ampmod(Ec,Em,fm,fc,fs);
