fmdemod

Analog Frequency demodulation

Calling Sequence

[y] = fmdemod(x,Vc,Em,Ec,fc,fs)

Parameters

Ec:carrier signal amplitude in volts
Em:Message signal amplitude in volts
fc:carrier signal frequency in Hz
fs:sampling frequency in samples/sec
Vc:carrier signal
y:Frequency demodulated signal

Description

fmdemod -It demodulates the FM modulated signal

Examples

Em = 2;//2 volts
Ec = 6;//6 volts
fc = 10;//in hertz
fs = 100;//in samples/sec
y = fmdemod(x,Vc,Em,Ec,fc,fs);
