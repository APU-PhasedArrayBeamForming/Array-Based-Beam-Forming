fmmod

Analog Frequency modulation

Calling Sequence

[x,Vm,Vc] = fmmod(Ec,Em,fm,fc,fs)

Parameters

Ec:carrier signal amplitude in volts
Em:Message signal amplitude in volts
fm:Message signal frequency in Hz
fc:carrier signal frequency in Hz
fs:sampling frequency in samples/sec
Vs:Message signal
Vc:carrier signal
x:Frequency modulated signal

Description

fmmod -It generates Analog FM modulated signal

Examples

Em = 2;//2 volts
Ec = 6;//6 volts
fm = 5;//in hertz
fc = 10;//in hertz
fs = 100;//in samples/sec
[x,Vm,Vc] = fmmod(Ec,Em,fm,fc,fs);
