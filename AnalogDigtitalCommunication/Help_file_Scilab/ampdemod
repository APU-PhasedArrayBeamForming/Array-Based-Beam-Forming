ampdemod

Amplitude demodulation using envelope demodulation technique

Calling Sequence

[y] = ampdemod(x,Vc,fc,fs,Em,Ec)

Parameters

x: AM modulated signal
Vc: carrier signal
fc:carrier frequency in Hz
Em:message signal amplitude in volts
Ec:carrier signal amplitude in volts
fs:sampling frequency in samples/sec
y:demodulated signal

Description

ampdemod -performs amplitude demodulation using envelope demodulation

Examples

Em = 8; //8 volts
Ec = 10; //20 volts
fm = 2; //2 Hz
fc = 10; //10 Hz
fs = 100; samples/sec
x = ampmod(Ec,Em,fm,fc,fs);//AM modulation
Vc =Ec*sin(2*%pi*fc*t);
y = ampdemod(x,Vc,fc,fs,Em,Ec);
